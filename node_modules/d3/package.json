  "readme": "# D3\n\n**D3** is a small, free JavaScript library for manipulating HTML documents\nbased on data. D3 can help you quickly visualize your data as HTML or SVG,\nhandle interactivity, and incorporate smooth transitions and staged animations\ninto your pages. You can use D3 as a visualization framework (like Protovis),\nor you can use it to build dynamic pages (like jQuery).\n\n### Browser Support\n\nD3 should work on any browser, with minimal requirements such as JavaScript\nand the [W3C DOM](http://www.w3.org/DOM/) API. By default D3 requires the\n[Selectors API](http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api/) Level 1, but you can\npreload [Sizzle](http://sizzlejs.com/) for compatibility with older browsers.\nSome of the included D3 examples use additional browser features, such as\n[SVG](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/) and [CSS3\nTransitions](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/). These features are not\nrequired to use D3, but are useful for visualization! D3 is not a\ncompatibility layer. The examples should work on Firefox, Chrome (Chromium),\nSafari (WebKit), Opera and IE9.\n\nNote: Chrome has strict permissions for reading files out of the local file\nsystem. Some examples use AJAX which works differently via HTTP instead of local\nfiles. For the best experience, load the D3 examples from your own machine via\nHTTP. Any static file web server will work; for example you can run Python's\nbuilt-in server:\n\n    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888\n\nOnce this is running, go to: <http://localhost:8888/examples/>\n\n### Development Setup\n\nThis repository should work out of the box if you just want to create new\nvisualizations using D3. On the other hand, if you want to extend D3 with new\nfeatures, fix bugs, or run tests, you'll need to install a few more things.\n\nD3's test framework uses [Vows](http://vowsjs.org), which depends on\n[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](http://npmjs.org/). If you are\ndeveloping on Mac OS X, an easy way to install Node and NPM is using\n[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):\n\n    brew install node\n    brew install npm\n\nNext, from the root directory of this repository, install D3's dependencies:\n\n    make install\n\nYou can see the list of dependencies in package.json. NPM will install the\npackages in the node_modules directory.\n",
